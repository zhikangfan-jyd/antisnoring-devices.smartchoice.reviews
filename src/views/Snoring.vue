              <h2 class="area-title">How SilentSnore Works?</h2>
              <div class="how-container">
                    <p>The magnets in StopSnore gently apply pressure in the nose, widening nostrils. This allows air to flow through the nose. When this happens, breathing starts to take place with ease through the nose. With the air moving easier and more regularly, the throat vibrations mentioned earlier are reduced or eliminated.</p>

You could change the position you sleep in and try sleeping on your side or sleeping with your head raised. Using the right type of pillow can help with this. Making healthier choices such as limiting alcohol consumption, not smoking, getting enough sleep, drinking more water and cutting down on inflammatory foods will also help significantly. Treat chronic allergies with the help of your doctor and avoid sleeping pills too as they can actually cause snoring. Many snorers experience even faster success when trying these strategies alongside their anti-snoring device. Good luck and sleep well!</p>`
